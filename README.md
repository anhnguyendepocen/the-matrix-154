This project consists of an automated text categorization task (Sebastiani 2002) applied to text documents collected from Project Gutenberg, a free ebook archive. The documents are categorized into 4 genres: “Child”, “History”, “Religion”, and “Science”. A human would be able to classify these documents without much effort but it would be very time consuming to do so for thousands or millions of documents. The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning classifier to correctly categorize the texts as accurately as possible. Our primary feature set is a word-feature matrix which counts the number of times each word occurs in a document, known as a bag of words model. We extend this word feature matrix with bigrams, trigrams, and meta-features related to statistics on word and character usage. We use support vector machine and random forest methods, test on new text files, and measure the test error of each method. Our final model is a gradient boosted machine.
