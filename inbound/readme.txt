This directory is empty in Git but should contain a "Training" directory on each of our local computers that holds all of the training data from bcourses. The directory is not tracked in git in order to save file space.

After unzipping the file, the “Training directory” should have four subdirectories:
- Child_0
- History_1
- Religion_2
- Science_3
